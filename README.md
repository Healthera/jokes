# Ryan's Healthera Tech Test
---------------------

## Overview

  This is my attempt at a joke tech Test for Healthera. I will try to complete this in 3 hours or less.
  I completed this in 2h 30m

  The App is as modular as possible and was created with repurpose in mind.

  I repurposed an earlier mongoDB backend that I had made a few weeks prior and adapted it to this challenge.

  The feature testing and the webpage layout was all TDD
  The model testing was done manually and with postman
